Jaeger has been nerfed over the past few years because of the controversies surrounding him saying that "Jaeger is too OP"

Some notable nerfs:

- Loosing his ACOG optic on his 416-C
- ADS has a 10 second cooldown (But has infinite charges)
- He's now a 2 Speed 2 Armour instead of 3 Speed 1 Armour

Although this doesn't affect me as I play other Operators like Thunderbird and Thorn this is quite depressing
for the Jaeger mains.

But I think Jaeger is still a viable Operator to play, his ADS doesn't need to be re-placed like before when it only had 2 charges and since the last season where it brings all 1.0x scopes to other weapons (excluding Kali's primary weapon) using the Reflex (B) site or Holographic (A) are the best optics (In my opinion)

## Final Thoughts

Jaeger mains are just gods. (Bandit mains too)

But in all honesty, people have skill issues.
